# No.7 module

In this module, I was required to create jobs in order to treate a .net application.

I had to configure a windows agent for jenkins.<br>
The module comprised seven jons, that checking out the code, build the application using msbuild, running static code analysis, testing using mstest, packageing using nuget, upload to nexus nuget repo and notifying slack.

The repo contains snapshot of all the seven jobs. Every job comprised three jobs.
