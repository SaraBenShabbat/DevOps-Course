# Vagrnat

In this module, I was required to automate - launching virtual machines with docker installed on them.

I had to write vagrant files to launch ubuntu and centos virtual machines - servers.

I had also to write and to run a script on the system bootstarp to install docker appropriate to the linux distribution.
