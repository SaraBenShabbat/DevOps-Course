# Kubernetes

In this module, I was required to deploy a kubernetes cluster. <br>
I could choose which technology to use to perform this task. I chose to deploy the k8s cluster via ansible using kubespray.

This repository has a folder containing the replica of kubespary repository, after changing a few things to fit my specific needs.

Sometimes, I had to test some little things; for such as these things - I also setup minikube.
